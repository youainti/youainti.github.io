<h3 id="social-planners-problems">Social Planner’s Problems</h3>
<p>This is where we look for a policy function and value function describing the optimal path through time.</p>
<h3 id="arrow-debreu-time-zero">Arrow-Debreu (Time-Zero)</h3>
<p>This describes where all the trading of state dependent securities occurs at time-zero, and then all contracts are executed as time and history progress.</p>
<p>The key parts of the model consist of the constraint, which is a single constraint for the whole time period, taking the form: <br /><span class="math display">∑<sub><em>t</em></sub>∑<sub><em>s</em><sup><em>t</em></sup></sub>{<em>c</em><sub><em>t</em></sub><sup><em>i</em></sup>(<em>s</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>) − <em>y</em><sub><em>t</em></sub><sup><em>i</em></sup>(<em>s</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>)} ≤ 0</span><br /> Where <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>t</em></sub><sup><em>i</em></sup>(<em>s</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>), <em>y</em><sub><em>t</em></sub><sup><em>i</em></sup>(<em>s</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>), <em>q</em><sub><em>t</em></sub><sup>0</sup>(<em>s</em><sup><em>t</em></sup>)</span> represent the expenditures, income, and</p>
<h3 id="arrow-sequential">Arrow (Sequential)</h3>
<p>This describes where markets open once per time period. Again the key portion of the model is the constraint, where there is a constraint for each time period. This constraint takes the form of: <br /><span class="math display">∑<sub><em>s</em><sup><em>t</em></sup></sub></span><br /></p>

<h3 id="tree-cutting-and-other-toys">Tree Cutting and other toys</h3>
<p>Toy models are often used to illuistrate attributes about solving models or behavior in certain situations. Their relevance to real world outcomes is generally minimal. They are used to develop intuition and illuistrate model development and interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="real-business-cycle">Real Business Cycle</h3>
<p>One way of modeling general economies. Assumptions include that there are complete markets, that there are representative agents, and that there are stochastic productivity shocks.</p>
<p>Generally there are 3 agents</p>
<ul>
<li>Households</li>
<li>Firms</li>
<li>Governments</li>
</ul>
<p>and the “markets” that must be taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="solution-concepts">Solution Concepts</h4>
<h5 id="time-zero-trading-equilibrium">Time-Zero Trading Equilibrium</h5>
<p>Consists of a few general sets of equations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Household Decision Rules</li>
<li>Household value function (possibly)</li>
<li>Firm Pricing Rules</li>
<li>Government Transfer Rules (Sometimes Given)</li>
<li>Market Clearing Conditions</li>
<li>Market Transition rules</li>
<li>Consistency Conditions between household decision and market transition rules</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sequential-trading">Sequential Trading</h5>
<p>Consists of a couple general sets of equations</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial allocation of wealth</li>
<li>Household Decision Rules</li>
<li>Household value function (possibly)</li>
<li>Firm Pricing Rules</li>
<li>Government Transfer Rules (Sometimes Given)</li>
<li>Market Clearing Conditions</li>
<li>Market Transition rules</li>
<li>Consistency Conditions between household decision and market transition rules</li>
