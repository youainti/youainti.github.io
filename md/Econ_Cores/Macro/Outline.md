## Types of Questions

### Social Planner's Problems
This is where we look for a policy function and value function
describing the optimal path through time.

### Arrow-Debreu (Time-Zero)
This describes where all the trading of state dependent securities
occurs at time-zero, and then all contracts are executed as time
and history progress.

The key parts of the model consist of the constraint, which is
a single constraint for the whole time period, taking the form:
$$
\sum_t \sum_{s^t} \big\{ c_t^i(s^t) - y_t^i(s^t) \big\}    \leq 0
$$
Where $c_t^i(s^t), y_t^i(s^t), q_t^0(s^t)$ represent 
the expenditures, income, and

### Arrow (Sequential)
This describes where markets open once per time period.
Again the key portion of the model is the constraint, where there
is a constraint for each time period. 
This constraint takes the form of:
$$
\sum_{s^t} 
$$

## Model Types
### Tree Cutting and other toys
Toy models are often used to illuistrate attributes about solving models or behavior in certain situations. 
Their relevance to real world outcomes is generally minimal.
They are used to develop intuition and illuistrate model development and interpretation.

### Real Business Cycle
One way of modeling general economies. 
Assumptions include that there are complete markets, that there are representative agents, and that there are stochastic productivity shocks.

Generally there are 3 agents 

 * Households
 * Firms
 * Governments

and the "markets" that must be taken into account.

#### Solution Concepts
##### Time-Zero Trading Equilibrium
Consists of a few general sets of equations.

- Household Decision Rules
- Household value function (possibly)
- Firm Pricing Rules
- Government Transfer Rules (Sometimes Given)
- Market Clearing Conditions
- Market Transition rules
- Consistency Conditions between household decision and market transition rules

##### Sequential Trading
Consists of a couple general sets of equations

- Initial allocation of wealth
- Household Decision Rules
- Household value function (possibly)
- Firm Pricing Rules
- Government Transfer Rules (Sometimes Given)
- Market Clearing Conditions
- Market Transition rules
- Consistency Conditions between household decision and market transition rules


### Asset Pricing Models



### Market Descriptions



## Solution Methods

### Discrete Time

#### Lagrange Method
This was used for asset pricing, usually in the sequential form.

#### Bellman Method


### Continuouus Time
#### HJB

## Quantitative methods
### Calibration
### GMM
