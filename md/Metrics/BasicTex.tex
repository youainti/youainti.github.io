\section{Logit Models}
The idea is to capture the probability of a choice from a choice set.
Must include those who didn't make a choice. %I need to look this up and get information about it.

\subsection{With explanatory variables}
\subsubsection{Multinomial Logit model}
Suppose you have a choice set and explanatory variables that describe the 
individual decision makers.

Example: Car Shopping 
\begin{itemize}
 - Options: sedan, truck, suv
 - Explanatory: Income, years of schooling, 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conditional Logit model}
Suppose you have a choice set and explanatory variables that describe the 
situation under which the choice was made.

Example: Car Shopping
\begin{itemize}
 - Options: sedan, truck, suv
 - Explanatory: Number of Seats, MPG, price at time of sale
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Mixed Logit model}
Suppose you have a choice set and explanatory variables that describe both 
decison makers and situation under which the choice was made.

\subsection{Theoretical Development}

### From Choice Models


### McFadden's (1974) Derivation
Let $B$ represent a choice set and let $S$ represent explanatory variables.
Then for $ x \neq y, {x,y} \in B$ and $s \in S$.
#### Axioms
 - Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives: $\frac{Pr(x|s,B)}{Pr(y|s,B)} = \frac{Pr(x|s,\{x,y\})}{Pr(y|s,\{x,y\})}$
 - Positivity: $\forall x\in B, Pr(x|s,B) > 0$
 - Log Odds Utility: #describe better $v(x|s,y) = \log \frac{Pr(x|s,B)}{Pr(y|s,B)}$
 - Additively Seperable Utility: $v(x|s,y) = v(x|s) - v(y|s)$

#### Proof
To copy from example

## Interpretations

### Shift effects

### Marginal Effects
Let $Q(x) = Pr(x|s)$
$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = DO IT
$$
#### Elasticieties
As $\epsilon_{Q,x} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \farc{x}{Q} = DO IT$
