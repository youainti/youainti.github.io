# Philosophy of Economics
Like many scientific disciplines, economics has a philosophical background that
is crucial to understanding both the theories and practices of economists.

Notice the two distinctions, into theories and practices.
I am going to briefly discuss the first and devote most of the discussion to
the second.

In philosophy as in religion, 
[Stendahl's Rules of Religious Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krister_Stendahl)
 are a useful way to seek understanding without being consumed by dogmatism.

I believe an understanding of economic, scientific, mathematical, and 
statistical philosopies are crucial to understanding the goals of economics
and evaluating the applied practice of economics in persuit of those goals.

## Philosophy in Theories
By philosophy in theories, I am referring to the beliefs that underpin the
theories of economics (e.g. Rational Agent Framework, 
Utility Maximization, etc.)
Currently I feel that most of the philosophy in theories is captured in the
mathematical description of the theories.
Of course, some schools of philosophy contend that mathematics cannot describe
economics.

## Philosophy in Practice
Below are a few major topic headings and papers that discuss various ways 
to approach and evaluate economics.
