<h4 id="directory-markdown">Directory: markdown</h4>
<p>This is where I do my actual writing. I don’t know html very well and would prefer to keep this simple. Markdown meets the bill.</p>
<h4 id="directory-html">Directory: html</h4>
<p>This is where I keep my ‘pandoc’ generated pages that are actually accessible.</p>
<h4 id="directory-resources">Directory: resources</h4>
<p>This is where I keep my copies of resources that I own and want to include. I’ve got it roughtly split out by the types of resources.</p>
