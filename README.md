This is my personal, public website. 

## About me


## Organization of website

### Underlying organization
You will note a few folders

- markdown
 - html
 - resources

#### Directory: markdown

This is where I do my actual writing. 
I don't know html very well and would prefer to keep this simple.
Markdown meets the bill.

#### Directory: html
This is where I keep my 'pandoc' generated pages that are actually accessible.

#### Directory: resources
This is where I keep my copies of resources that I own and want to include.
I've got it roughtly split out by the types of resources.

 - pdfs
 - images
