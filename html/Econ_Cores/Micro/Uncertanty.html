<h1 id="uncertanty-and-lotteries">Uncertanty and Lotteries</h1>
<p>Prep for Cores 2020-05 <strong><em> </em></strong> # General Approach ## Assumputions <strong>Consequentialist premise:</strong> Consumers care only about the “reduced” simple lottery not the full compound lottery.</p>
<p><strong>Continuity:</strong> The preference relation over lotteries is continuous.</p>
<p>Given the preference relation <span class="math inline">\(R(a,b)\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> preferred to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> - for the lotteries <span class="math inline">\(l,l&#39;,l&#39;&#39; \in L\)</span>, the following two sets are closed.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\big\{\alpha \ni [0,1]: R({}_{l}\alpha_{l&#39;},l&#39;&#39;)\big\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\big\{\alpha \ni [0,1]: R(l&#39;&#39;,{}_{l}\alpha_{l&#39;})\big\}\)</span></p>
<p>This eliminate the possibility of lexographic like preference relations.</p>
<p><strong>Independence Axiom:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\forall l,l&#39;,l&#39;&#39; \in L \wedge \alpha \in [0,1]\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
R(l,l&#39;) \Leftrightarrow  R({}_{l}\alpha_{l&#39;&#39;},{}_{l&#39;}\alpha_{l&#39;&#39;})
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="expected-utility-form">Expected Utility Form</h2>
<p><strong>V.NM Expected Utility Function:</strong> Over the (finite) simple lottery <span class="math inline">\(l = [l_1, l_2 \dots l_n]^T\)</span>, there exists a set of coefficents <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> such that if you treat them as vectors, the utility can be written as a dot product. <span class="math display">\[
U(l) = u \cdot l
\]</span> In other words, the utility is linear in the probabilities probabilities <span class="math inline">\(l_i \in l\)</span>.</p>
<p>We often say that it is in v.NM form iff it is linear in probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Utility Theorem</strong> If a rational preferernce relation over lotteries satisfies continuity and the independence axiom, then it must be representable in a v.NM form.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="paradoxes">Paradoxes</h2>
<p>These are differences between the way preferences should work with the continuity and IA assumptions, but how they differ in reality.</p>
<h3 id="allais-paradox">Allais Paradox</h3>
<p>Two sets of two lotteries over <span class="math inline">\([2.5e6, 5e5, 0e0]\)</span>,</p>
<p>Make a choice in each set - First set is <span class="math inline">\(L_1 = [0,1,0]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_1&#39; = [0.1,0.89,0.01]\)</span> - Second set is <span class="math inline">\(L_2 = [0,0.11,0.89]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2&#39; = [0.1,0,0.90]\)</span></p>
<p>It can be shown that this violates I.A.</p>

<h1 id="money-lotteries">Money Lotteries</h1>
<p>We are treating <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as a monetary event.</p>
<h2 id="risk-adversion">Risk Adversion</h2>
<p>Consider the lottery <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> over outcomes <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
U(F) = \int u(x) F(x) dx
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Bernoulli Utility function:</strong> is the term <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span>, i.e. the utility from a given outcome <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Von Neumann-Morgenstern (v.NM) Utility Function:</strong> is the term <span class="math inline">\(U(F)\)</span>, i.e. the utility over the lottery. Note that it is linear in <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, the probability distribution, but this time has a “infinite” sum (integral).</p>
<p><strong>Risk Adverse:</strong> IFF <span class="math inline">\(E(u(x)) \leq u(E(x))\)</span> for “all” probability distributions. In other words, Risk adverse if satisfies concave Jensen’s Inequality.</p>
<p><strong>Certanty Equivalent:</strong> The certanty equivalent is <span class="math inline">\(c(F,u)\)</span> such that \[ u(c(F,u)) = E(u(x)) = u(x)f(x)dx \]</p>
<p><strong>Probability Premium:</strong> The probability premium is <span class="math inline">\(\pi(x,\epsilon,u)\)</span> such that for certain outcome <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
u(y) = [ \frac{1}{2} + \pi ] u(x+\epsilon)
        + [ \frac{1}{2} - \pi ] u(x-\epsilon)
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Absolute Risk Adversion</strong> <span class="math inline">\(r_A(x) = \frac{-u&#39;&#39;(x)}{u&#39;(x)}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Relative Risk Adversion</strong> <span class="math inline">\(r_R(x) = x \frac{-u&#39;&#39;(x)}{u&#39;(x)} = x \cdot r_A(x)\)</span></p>
<h3 id="risk-adverse-equivalent-conditions">Risk Adverse Equivalent Conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Concave utility function.</li>
<li>The certanty equivalent is less than the expected value of the monetary event.</li>
<li>The Probability premium is positive.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="ordering-of-lotteries">Ordering of Lotteries</h2>
<p><strong>First Order Stochastic Dominance</strong> Expected value of one lottery is greater than another.</p>
<p><strong>Second Order Stochastic Dominance</strong> Variance of one lottery is less than another when their expected values match.</p>
