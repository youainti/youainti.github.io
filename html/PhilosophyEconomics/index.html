<h1 id="philosophy-of-economics">Philosophy of Economics</h1>
<p>Like many scientific disciplines, economics has a philosophical background that is crucial to understanding both the theories and practices of economists.</p>
<p>Notice the two distinctions, into theories and practices. I am going to briefly discuss the first and devote most of the discussion to the second.</p>
<p>In philosophy as in religion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krister_Stendahl">Stendahl’s Rules of Religious Understanding</a> are a useful way to seek understanding without being consumed by dogmatism.</p>
<p>I believe an understanding of economic, scientific, mathematical, and statistical philosopies are crucial to understanding the goals of economics and evaluating the applied practice of economics in persuit of those goals.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-in-theories">Philosophy in Theories</h2>
<p>By philosophy in theories, I am referring to the beliefs that underpin the theories of economics (e.g. Rational Agent Framework, Utility Maximization, etc.) Currently I feel that most of the philosophy in theories is captured in the mathematical description of the theories. Of course, some schools of philosophy contend that mathematics cannot describe economics.</p>
